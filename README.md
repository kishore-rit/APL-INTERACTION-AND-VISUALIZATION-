*DESCRIPTION*:

This Python script—developed by intern Kishore R from Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology during a Codetech IT Solutions internship—demonstrates how to visualize weather data across five major Indian cities using matplotlib and seaborn. Although API access isn’t available in the testing environment, the script employs carefully curated sample data to mimic real-world conditions, ensuring that the core visualization logic remains identical to what would be used with live inputs.

Key steps and features:

1. Data Preparation

Cities: Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata

Temperature (°C): 34.2, 28.4, 31.8, 35.5, 32.1

Humidity (%): 62, 70, 75, 58, 66

Weather conditions: Clear, Clouds, Rain, Clear, Clouds



2. Styling and Configuration

Seaborn’s “whitegrid” style with the “Set2” palette

Custom matplotlib settings for a clean white background, bold titles (15 pt), and labels (12 pt)



3. Visualizations

Bar Plot (Temperature Comparison)
Displays each city’s average temperature with value annotations atop each bar, making differences immediately clear.

Line Plot (Humidity Trends)
Plots humidity percentages in sequence, complete with markers, gridlines, and data labels for quick interpretation of relative humidity levels.

Pie Chart (Weather Condition Distribution)
Illustrates the proportion of each weather type among the five cities, highlighting how often conditions like “Clear” or “Clouds” occur.



4. Output and Reporting

Prints a summary of the sample data to the console

Generates and displays each plot in turn, ensuring a neat layout via plt.tight_layout()

Concludes with a confirmation message, reaffirming successful completion of Task 1 (API Integration & Data Visualization)
